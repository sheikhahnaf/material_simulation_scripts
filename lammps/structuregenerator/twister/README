The input file, twist.inp, here is constructed using i = 9
entry of hex.table (../../hex.table).

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of one Mo atom and 
two S atoms. Both layers are constructed using this basis.
Hence the stacking is AA at the origin.

To run this example, run from command line:

python path_to_Twister_1.0/src/twister.py

The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting 
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat

A reference Quantum Espresso input file, in.QE, for 
this superlattice is also provided.

If the plotting takes too long, you can turn the plotting 
flag to False in twist.inp
